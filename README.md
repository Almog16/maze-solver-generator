Maze Solver/Generator, implemented in C++.
======
Description:
------
This program can generate a new maze, or solve an existing one.

This project demonstrates my implementation of the Queue and Stack data structures from scratch, which, in turn, are used by the algorithm that solves/generates mazes.

How to use:
------
    Select the desired option:
    	1) Submit an existing maze, the program will solve it for you
    	2) Let the program generate and solve a random maze for you
    Afterwards, please submit the maze's dimensions (rows, cols)
    If you chose option 1, please submit your maze, line by line.
